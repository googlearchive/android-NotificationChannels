Android NotificationChannels Sample
===================================

Demonstration of using channels to categorize notifications by topic. This feature was
            added in Android O, and allows users to have fine-grained control over their
            notification preferences.

Introduction
------------

Android O introduces notification channels to provide a unified system to help users
manage notifications. When you target Android O, you must implement one or more
notification channels to display notifications to your users.

You can create a notification channel for each distinct type of notification you need
to send. You can also create notification channels to reflect choices made by users of
your app. For example, you might setup separate notification channels for each
conversation group created by a user in a messaging app.

To create a channel, call `[NotificationManager.createNotificationChannels()][1]`. You
can then use `[Notification.Builder.setChannel()][2]` to assign your notification to that
channel.

Users can now manage most of the settings associated with notifications using a
consistent system UI. All notifications posted to a notification channel behave the
same. To access the settings screen, use the `ACTION_CHANNEL_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS`
intent:

```
Intent intent = new Intent(Settings.ACTION_CHANNEL_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS);
intent.putExtra(Settings.EXTRA_CHANNEL_ID, mChannel.getId());
intent.putExtra(Settings.EXTRA_APP_PACKAGE, getPackageName());
startActivity(intent);
```
